# shadow_test.rt
# A scene designed to test shadows cast by a sphere and a cylinder.

# A: Ambient light. Low intensity to make shadows noticeable but not pure black.

# L: Light source. Positioned high up (y=20) and to the left/front (x=-20, z=0).
# This will cast shadows diagonally down and to the right/back.

# sp: A red sphere. Its center is at y=0, so it floats 10 units above the plane.

# cy: A blue cylinder. It is placed off to the right and further back.
# Its center is at y=0, making it float above the plane as well.
# Its axis is (0,1,0), so it is standing upright.
