I need help on the miniRT (RayTracing) project described below.
It will be a group programming project for 2 students.
As a first step the project should be divided in two. The 2 students should have tasks which can be tested independently, and after those are working the branches should be brought together.
We're starting with the mandatory part, and we decide later about the bonus.
Can you help with a detailed plan?

I need help on the miniRT (RayTracing) project (described in miniRT.md).
It will be a group programming project for 2 students. We made a first draft of the collaboration plan (in collaborationPlan.md).
We're starting with the mandatory part, and we decide later about the bonus.

Please revise the collaboration plan, make it more detailed, and feel free to correct the list of functions and structures to implement. 

We are new to Ray Tracing, but I understood that there are many methods to implement. According to my initial investigation, the Ray Tracing with recursion could fit our needs, since we can set the recursion depth to 1, and we might increase it later depending on the rendering time vs quality tradeoff.

You can also suggest other Ray Tracing method to implement, and explain why would that be better for our project.
